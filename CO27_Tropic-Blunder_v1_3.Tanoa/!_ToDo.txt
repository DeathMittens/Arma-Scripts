To do list

	Test on server with players:
		- vehicle lock status at base
		- ACRE respawn & spectate functionality check w/ zeus respawn module
		- Rescue recon squad to base objective and vehicle lock trigger
	
	- Addition: lock DAC spawned armour vehicles with event config
	
	- Clean up ACE settings / review what may be server side forced
		- Currently server forced at time of writing:
			Fatigue
			Hearing
			ACE Map - illumination
			ACE Medical
			Ace Name Tags
			Ace Night Vision
			DUI - Squad Radar - Indicators - Show indicators forced off
			
		- Current mission forced / changed:
			- Basic medical - changed back to server side settings
			- ACE Fatigure with very forgiving settings & fast stamina regen
			- Disabled ACE hearing
			- ACE vehicle lock CHANGED to 'AS IS' due to interfering with the mission
			- ACRE 2 terrain loss coefficient changed to 0.5

	- no reslot for respawn allowed due to framework. Implemented A Zeus force respawn module for now, 
 
 
	- Fast roping enabled on the transport helicopter... could be a mistake?
